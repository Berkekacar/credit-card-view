# SwiftUI Credit Card View 
## Credit Card Form

This project is a dynamic and interactive credit card form developed using Swift and SwiftUI. The form includes a credit card view that visually reflects the data entered into the form fields, providing a realistic user experience.

## Features

 - Interactive Card View: The credit card displays the entered information in real-time. When the CVV field is focused, the card flips to show the back side; otherwise, it shows the front side. This transition is animated for a smooth user experience.
- Expiration Date Handling: The expiration date field in the form defaults to the current month and year.
- Card Type Detection: The type of card (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) is automatically detected based on the entered card number.
- Formatted Card Number: The card number is displayed in a 4x4 format, and the input is limited to a - maximum of 16 digits.
- CVV Input: The CVV field accepts up to 4 digits and is shown only when the card flips to its back side.

## How It Works

- Card Flipping: The card flips to its back side with an animation when the CVV field is focused. This provides a realistic representation of where the CVV code is located on a physical card.
- Dynamic Form: The form updates the card view in real-time as the user inputs data. The card number, expiration date, and CVV are all reflected immediately on the card view.
- Default Expiration Date: The expiration date field starts with the current month and year, simplifying data entry for the user.
